		<h1>About Us</h1>
		<p>PUP is a public, non-sectarian, non-profit institution of higher learning primarily tasked with 
		harnessing the tremendous human resources potential of the nation by improving the physical, 
		intellectual and material well-being of the individual through higher occupational, technical and 
		professional instruction and training in the applied arts and sciences related to the fields of commerce, 
		business administration, and technology.The University promotes applied research, advanced studies and progressive leadership in the stated fields. We also offer ladder-type higher vocational, distance learning (open university system), technical and professional programs in the area of business and distributive arts, education and the social sciences related to the fields of commerce, business administration and other polytechnic areas. Furthermore, the University takes steps to enrich the academic program in other fields of study and adopts a polytechnic program of education designed to provide the individual with employable skills and managerial know-how in order to make them creative, productive and self-reliant.Scholars of the Nation (Iskolar ng Bayan), that is what we call our students because the Philippine Government and other non-government institutions subsidize their tuition and other fees. More than a hundred of the student population are foreigners from China, Singapore, Indonesia, Cambodia, Myanmar, Tanzania, Nigeria, and Ghana. They are enrolled in business, language, statistics, communication, and education courses in the undergraduate and graduate levels. Students from Korea regularly visit PUP in summer to take up Intensive English courses.
</p>    
        <h1>History</h1>
		<p>The history of PUP may well parallel the nation's growth and development. As it met the needs of a fledgling Philippine civil service under American rule forged from anvil of Spanish colonialism, so will it serve the rising expectations of the people in the 21st century...desirous now of reclaiming their rightful place in the community of independent nations. As it has withstood the test of time, so will it continue to pace contemporary Philippine history.
			In response to the demand for training personnel for the government service and to the felt need to provide skills essential for private business employment, the Manila Business School was founded on October 19, 1904 as part of a City School system under the superintendence of G. A. O'Reilly.
			Through Republic Act (RA) 778 passed by both houses of Congress on May 20, 1952 and signed by then Philippine President Elpidio Quirino on June 21, 1952, the PSC was converted into the Philippine College of Commerce (PCC).
			During this period, the PCC was converted into a chartered state university and accordingly renamed Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP) through Presidential Decree (PD) 1341. This led to the broadening of course offerings and the restructure/streamlining of the University's administrative organization.
			This period brought about a dramatic change in the University and reaffirmed its commitment to education as an equalizing instrument in the development of the youth in preparation for their role and responsibility in the progress and development of the nation.
			To keep pace with changing conditions, the University underwent continuous change. During this period, the first lady president of the University was appointed, the first University president underwent a selection committee, a series of infrastructure projects were made, and an ICT infrastructure was built.
			PUP celebrated its centenary during this period. It has gone far from what it was more than a century ago. PUP continues to be a partner in nation-building and in poverty alleviation for the marginalized sector of society with quality, responsive, and relevant education as a tool.
			The University has been and has sustained its role as a worthy catalyst of change for the improvement and raising the quality of lives of its graduates and their families being the centerpiece of its mission as a state university. PUP continues to make significant contributions to the social and economic development of our country.

         <h2>PUP Quezon City</h2>
		 <p>Started as petitions to have a higher educational institution for the youth at the National Government Center area from the community organizations and church groups and negotiations with local officials and other government agencies, the PUP Quezon City Campus is a pantheon of concrete success towards the struggle in people’s fight against ignorance. As enshrined on the Deed of Assignment on 24 March 1997, that is, “to establish a branch or an extension of PUP at the National Government Center with a mandate to bring quality education and subsidized tuition fees to the urban poor communities of Quezon City, with priority given to those from the NGCHP.” Since its establishment in 1997, PUP Quezon City continues to produce quality and globally competitive graduates in the areas of education, information technology, management, marketing, entrepreneurship and office management technology. Likewise, true to the University’s mandate as Pamantasan ng Bayan, its graduate degree thru the Open University education system increased by offering two additional programs including the first program offering as practical alternative venue from PUP Main Campus, namely:
<br><br>
1.Master in Educational Management<br>
2.Master in Information Technology<br>
3.Master in Public Administration</p>
