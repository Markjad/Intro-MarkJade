        <p>PUP is a public, non-sectarian, non-profit institution of higher learning primarily tasked with 
            harnessing the tremendous human resources potential of the nation by improving the physical, 
            intellectual and material well-being of the individual through higher occupational, technical and 
            professional instruction and training in the applied arts and sciences related to the fields of commerce, 
            business administration, and technology.The University promotes applied research, advanced studies and progressive leadership in the stated fields. We also offer ladder-type higher vocational, distance learning (open university system), technical and professional programs in the area of business and distributive arts, education and the social sciences related to the fields of commerce, business administration and other polytechnic areas. Furthermore, the University takes steps to enrich the academic program in other fields of study and adopts a polytechnic program of education designed to provide the individual with employable skills and managerial know-how in order to make them creative, productive and self-reliant.Scholars of the Nation (Iskolar ng Bayan), that is what we call our students because the Philippine Government and other non-government institutions subsidize their tuition and other fees. More than a hundred of the student population are foreigners from China, Singapore, Indonesia, Cambodia, Myanmar, Tanzania, Nigeria, and Ghana. They are enrolled in business, language, statistics, communication, and education courses in the undergraduate and graduate levels. Students from Korea regularly visit PUP in summer to take up Intensive English courses.
